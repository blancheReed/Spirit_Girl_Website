        <h1>Prologue: The Ancestral Moon</h1>
        <div class="Prologue">
          In the beginning of the dreamtime the tribe lived with a deep
          connection to the energies of the land. The lived together
          harmoniously with the plants, animals and the forces of celestial
          spirits continued to shape the world around the tribe’s people.
          Narnooloom awoke in the campsite. I was her marriage ceremony that was
          on her mind. She was promised to a respectful man and mighty warrior.
          However, the man that she sighted by the waterhole that stood alone in
          the trees watching her was also on her mind. She was intrigued by him.
          He was someone she hadn’t seen before. Narnooloom heard whispers in
          the tribe that a Featherfoot hunter was in the area. The elder woman
          Kubee could since his presence. Lurking in the shadows and fringes of
          the camp. She warned Featherfoot was a no-good spirit and if you feel
          his presence on the tracks in the bush to hold your breath until he
          passed so he couldn’t capture your spirit. Narnooloom wondered if the
          man she saw was this fulla Featherfoot. Narnooloom went back to the
          waterhole to freshen up. The bush was alive with the sound of children
          running down a nearby track with their mothers who were gathering
          grass for basket weaving. She looked at her reflection and jumped back
          startled. While she knelt over the water’s edge her reflection had a
          man standing behind her looking down. He had a thin bone through the
          septum of his nose. He’s eyes were jet black and fixed on Narnooloom
          with an unwavering focus. Her hand trembled. She was the only one at
          the waterhole and she couldn’t catch her breath. Then everything
          around her spun and she fell back unconscious. A chanting was echoing
          around Narnooloom as she came to. She noticed the cave paintings on
          the wall. There was a figure at the cave entrance. As she felt less
          dazed, she noticed the figures emu feathered shoes. The gazed up from
          the ground to his scared chest. He stood facing her. Narnooloom was
          speechless. She couldn’t use her voice to scream for help. A fire was
          burning in the middle of the cave. He sat next to Narnooloom. He put
          her hand on his face. She moved away after accidently touching his
          hair while moving back. His hair was covered in blood. This was
          Featherfoot the evil spirit from darkness. What was he going to do to
          her? He was a sorcerer who harnessed the power from beyond for
          malevolent acts. He preyed on people and took their spirit, so they
          were no longer living. Narnooloom wondered why her? She was so stupid
          for being alone today. She felt like this was the end. She didn’t want
          it to be the end. She had so much to live for like a marriage and her
          future children. No this can’t be the end she refuses this fate. Her
          destiny is to be an elder. She let out a scream that echoed out to the
          gorge. Featherfoot laughed. “No woman. They can’t hear you” he let her
          know. “Your long way from your country now” he giggled. He seemed
          amused about his abduction of Narnooloom. She tried to run past him.
          She was successful but then Featherfoot chanted “Wongi wobarn”. Black
          snakes appeared at the entrance of the cave. Narnooloom wasn’t sure
          they were real or an illusion. She ran toward nearest snake that
          hissed and coiled up to attack. “It’s not real” she thought to
          herself. So leapt over the snake that struck her with a venomous bite.
          Her calf muscle instantly stung with a sharp pain. She jumped back
          away from the entrance. There were too many snakes. She couldn’t pass.
          Narnooloom staggered back to the fire and laid next to it. The venom
          was acting fast. Too fast. Featherfoot smiled. “Woman. You’re a brave
          one” he told her. “I chose right” he confirmed to himself. Narnooloom
          passed out. She awoke on a bed of eucalyptus leaves with Featherfoot
          drawing on her stomach with a concoction of blood and white ochre rock
          paint. He drew circular lines around her stomach while he hummed. She
          looked down. Her stomach began to emanate a golden glow. The radiating
          glow was warm, but it didn’t hurt. She wiped sweat from her forehead.
          She was burning up. “Featherfoot. What are you doing?” she pleaded.
          Featherfoot didn’t answer. Suddenly, the glow dispersed lighting up
          the entire cave in the evening darkness. Narnooloom’s head fell back,
          and she was unconscious. The song of birds became louder as
          Narnooloom’s eyes opened. She was back at the waterhole. An Aunty
          spotted Narnooloom laying in the long grass surrounding the waterhole.
          She yelled out, “What you doin’ there? You’re meant to be back at
          camp. Your mother was lookin’ for you”. Narnooloom looked at the sky
          it was morning. The dew on the grass was on her skin. She pressed her
          hand down to stand up. She didn’t feel weak like in the cave. She felt
          an energy surging within that made her strong. She nodded to her
          Aunty. Narnooloom decided then and there she wouldn’t tell her family
          about Featherfoot or the cave. They would think she was cursed. Her
          body was clean with no marking on her stomach. There was no snake bite
          on her leg. She started to wonder if it had all been a dream. There
          was no trace of what she’d been through. The only thing was that she
          felt different. There was a pulsing in her chest that was strong, and
          she was more aware of her surroundings than ever before. Everything
          she saw was brighter and the sounds were a vibrant crisp harmony. Her
          mother rushed towards her once Narnooloom stepped into the camp. “My
          girl. Where you been?” said Novur to Narnooloom with concern. Novur
          had been preparing the gathering party with all the tribes’ women for
          Narnooloom’s marriage ceremony. “I thought you took off? No need to be
          scared. Gungunbill is a good man. He’ll make the perfect man for you”
          Novur insisted. Narnooloom smiled, “I know mum”. Narnooloom put that
          horrible night behind her. Dream or not she’d never know or so she
          thought.

        <h1>Chapter 1: Lost & Found</h1>
        <div class="ChapterOne">
          The evening was dark and alarming as the cyclone Booroomgar approached
          the coastal village. A scent of fear was fresh in the atmosphere
          whilst the people of Goondoberg prepared for the deluge that would
          soon set in. The downpour was predicted to be intense with floods
          pursuing the massive thunderstorms rapidly advancing. Cyclone
          Booroomgar was a category four with gusts up to 280 kilometre per
          hour. Yarra asked, “Dellgair, do you think the backyard is secure
          enough for this bloody storm?”. Dellgair went to tie down the outdoor
          patio sitting set. “Can you get Meeree’s bowl from the doghouse?”
          asked Yarra. Meeree yelped expecting to be fed. Dellgair patted Meeree
          and proceeded to the lounge where Yarra was taping the windows for
          added security against the cyclone. “How is the radio signal? Do we
          have extra batteries and a torch?” enquired Yarra. “Yeah, getting it
          all together. We’ll have to go in the bathroom if it gets to out of
          control” answered Dellgair. “I have the water bottles in the kitchen
          filled up” said Yarra. As cyclone Booroomgar raged through the night
          much damage was incurred to the town of Goondoberg. The floods through
          the town were flowing strong and had risen enough to burst the
          riverbanks. The cyclone passed and went out to the ocean. Many homes
          were destroyed or severely damaged. Luckily for Yarra and Dellgair the
          impact on their home was minimal. The next day Dellgair went for a
          walk along the coastline up to Bularm Beach. As he walked, he could
          hear a whimpering sound. There was still some debris on the sand
          including a tin roof that had ripped of the lifeguard’s headquarters.
          He was apprehensive about lifting the dishevelled wreckage but was
          certain the sound was a child. Could it be? Thought Dellgair. As he
          peered in, he felt a sharp push to his right knee that made him fall.
          Something rushed past him. He opened his eyes the sun glare blinding
          him. Then a girl said, “Where am I?”. Dellgair was shocked to think a
          child was left here or lost during the storm. “Are you ok little girl?
          Are you injured? Who are your parents?” Dellgair asked concerned. The
          girl looked confused and started to say, “I, I, I don’t know. I don’t
          have parents”. “What do you mean? You must have parents” Dellgair was
          as confused as the girl at this point. “Where am I?” asked the girl
          again. “You’re at Bularm Beach the coastline of Goondoberg” replied
          Dellgair. “We must go to the hospital. What is your name?” requested
          Dellgair. The girl was quiet and didn’t answer. “I’ll call the
          ambulance” Dellgair told the girl who was withdrawn. At the hospital
          the police arrived for Dellgair’s statement about the incident. He
          informed the police that the girl seemed to not know her parents and
          that she was very startled when he found her. Dellgair asked, “Is she
          injured?”. The policeman replied, “Only minimal scratches. She’ll be
          ok”. After that Dellgair went home to tell Yarra where he had been.
          Yarra was empathetic for the poor girls’ predicament and curious what
          would happen to her if her parents were never found. A week later in
          the newspaper Yarra read that the girl was still not reunited with her
          family. This was very troublesome for Yarra who was upset to think
          that perhaps the girl had been abandoned. She became more alarmed as
          she continued reading the article that stated a little boy was also
          discovered wondering down the Bellem Riverbanks. There was an appeal
          to the community to help find these children’s family. The reporter
          stated that the two children were looking for temporary foster parents
          until further investigations were completed. Yarra and Dellgair were
          both recently approved as foster carers with the child welfare
          department. Immediately Yarra called the child service’s officer that
          was affiliated to the foster arrangement program. She requested that
          both her and Dellgair be forwarded as applicants to take care of the
          two children. Three days later the girl was in their care at their
          home on Dunbarl Road. The boy was already given to the Doolgoo family.
          The Doolgoo’s lived close to the river near the bushland. They were
          friends of Yarra’s Aunty Toolar. It was now ten years later and the
          girl that Dellgair found on Bularm Beach was now called Yoorellgoo.
          She was a proud Munjoorum family member since Yoorellgoo was now
          officially adopted by Dellgair and Yarra. When the mail arrived with
          the adoption confirmation the document was put straight up on the
          fridge with a magnet. “You’re our girl now to all of them mob. This is
          a proud moment for me and your Mum” declared Dellgair. Yoorellgoo was
          about to turn 16 years old. Her birthday was celebrated on the day
          that Dellgair found her on Bularm Beach. The doctor said in her
          examination years ago that Yoorellgoo was about 6 years old when she
          was reported a lost child. So, even though it was a guess really about
          her birth year the arrangement the Munjoorum’s had for celebrating her
          birthday was just fine with Yoorellgoo. The boy who was found was
          welcomed into the Doolgoo home and was now their son. The
          circumstances about the boy were eerily similar to Yoorellgoo’s case.
          He had no recollection of who he was or where he came from. He was
          dazed and confused when assessed by the health care professionals. Of
          course, the assumption would be that the children were related
          incidences. Perhaps both abandoned by the same parents. However, the
          children did meet each other, and both had no idea who each other
          were. Carers of both children thought it appropriate to do a DNA test
          on the children to make certain they weren’t brother and sister. The
          DNA report stated that they were not siblings. The boy was now named
          Bellem Doolgoo. He was also 16 years old, and his parents liked the
          idea of celebrating his birthday on the day he was found. The same day
          as Yoorellgoo which was the day after cyclone Booroomgar. Over the
          years the Munjoorum’s and Doolgoo’s had become close friends. The
          parents were arranging a double sweet sixteen birthday party. As
          Yoorellgoo threw stone’s into Bellem River by the bank side she asked,
          “Bellem, do you think this birthday bash is going to be boring as
          hell?”. “I’ll bet no one from school shows” she added. “At least, well
          I’m pretty sure. I’ll be getting a car Yoorellgoo” replied Bellem.
          “Then we can drive to the city on the weekends” he explained. “I
          guess” she huffed. “I gotta get home Bellem. Mum wants to make a photo
          scrapbook for the party to humiliate me with my primary school
          pictures” Yoorellgoo said as she wiped the mud of her shoes on the
          walkway. Yoorellgoo made her way home. Yarra greeted Yoorellgoo at the
          door with a leather-bound scrapbook in hand. Yarra asked rhetorically,
          “You didn’t forget”. Yoorellgoo sarcastically answered, “Yay, neither
          did you”. Later that night as Yoorellgoo was laying in bed she looked
          out her window. The darkness of the night was always comforting to
          her. Especially the moons glow. Tonight, was a full moon so the light
          lit up the sky. As she slept the dreams of a distant place came to
          her. She didn’t recognise her surroundings, but she could hear a
          chanting rhythm in the distance. She moved closer to the sound that
          was now so loud she couldn’t hear her own thoughts. There was a
          glimpse of a tall woman with an aura of silver. Her face was hard and
          intense with a deep frown line in between her eyebrows. Yoorellgoo
          yelled out, “Who are you?”. Unexpectedly, Yoorellgoo was surrounded by
          the echo, “Narnooloom”. Yoorellgoo awoke but she was no longer in her
          bed or in her home on Dunbarl Road. She was at Bularm Beach under the
          palm trees with the breeze circling around her. She was frightened and
          thinking how did I get here? Yoorellgoo then realised she didn’t have
          her mobile phone with her either. She wondered, how am I going to call
          Dad and Mum? Yoorellgoo walked home it was a 30 min walk under the
          fullness of the moon. The sky was clear with plenty of light. So, she
          wasn’t too worried about the journey. Yoorellgoo knocked on the back
          door which was closer to her parents’ room. Yarra came to the door and
          asked sleepily, “What are you doing out there girl?”. Yoorellgoo just
          said she let Mearee out and the door closed behind her. She didn’t
          want to worry her Mum about the strange occurrences of the night.
          Bellem was just about to go to bed that night. He had been up playing
          video games. He crawled into bed feeling fatigued from a big day. As
          he slipped into a deep sleep, he felt a sensation of being pulled up
          in a sitting position. He wasn’t sure if he was awake or still
          dreaming. Then a vision of a woman in a desolate landscape come to
          him. She looked into his eyes and commanded, “You are chosen, do as I
          say. You will use your gifts to bring me glory”. Bellem fell back. He
          awoke in the mud by Bellem River. Absolutely bewildered he went home
          and thought he had been sleep walking. “I’ve never done that before”
          he thought to himself. Yoorellgoo woke with Yarra standing at her
          bedroom door. “You have your appointment with Dr. East today” Yarra
          reminded her. Yoorellgoo nodded yes. Today was going to be a long day.
          Yoorellgoo dreaded the impending appointment date. She didn’t look
          forward to being assessed in a clinical room. It was uncomfortable.
          Dr. East was a psychiatrist and the director of the mental health unit
          in Goondo Clinic. He was familiar with Yoorellgoo as she was a patient
          as a child. She was assessed and put on a mental health care plan due
          to the anxiety she had after the loss of her memories. Now Yoorellgoo
          was old enough to undergo hypnosis therapy to uncover past memories.
          The memories prior to being a lost child. The anxiety had only
          increased in her teens and she was placed on a mood stabiliser. That
          she refused to take. Yoorellgoo sat in the waiting room of the clinic.
          Her hands were sweaty, and she avoided eye contact with the other
          patients that she recognised from many previous visits. “There was no
          knowing what could set one of these womba mob off” she thought to
          herself. The wait was always nerve wrecking. She was just glad that
          they installed a tv in the area to keep her mind occupied while she
          waited. Yarra wasn’t there this time. She had to run errands for Aunty
          Toolar. Yoorellgoo preferred that she wasn’t there. It was Yarra’s
          fault she was there in the first place. She insisted that Yoorellgoo
          be assessed as a child. This led to years of further appointments,
          brain scans and advice from quacks. Yoorellgoo felt she didn’t belong
          in the mental health clinic. “Who wouldn’t be anxious not knowing who
          their real family was” she concluded. The animosity to Yarra was
          fleeting. Yoorellgoo knew her parents were always supportive toward
          her. “I definitely won’t tell Dr. East that I slept walked to the
          beach last night. He’ll only increase my meds” contemplated
          Yoorellgoo. Finally, the white door with the security code opened and
          her case manager Hilary asked, “Are you ready for your appointment
          Yoorellgoo?”. Dr East was sitting across the table when Yoorellgoo
          entered. He smiled pleasantly and motioned for Yoorellgoo to sit down.
          “How have you been since we last spoke” enquired Dr East. Yoorellgoo
          knew he’d then ask, “How has your anxiety been on the scale of one to
          ten”. So, she replied, “I’m fine. Anxiety has been a four”. She had no
          intention of telling him that she hadn’t taken a med since she’d
          stayed on ward last. Yoorellgoo was admitted to hospital inpatient
          care about 4 months ago. She was having a severe panic attack which
          was later resolved with an intramuscular injection. This calmed her
          enough to go to sleep but the malaise feeling never subsided and was
          always subtly present. Yoorellgoo wasn’t convinced that the medication
          was working, and she grew impatient with trying different treatments.
          She had been on Abilify, Zyprexa, Paliperidone, Lithium and Valium.
          The only thing it did was make her gain weight. Yarra had a different
          perspective on the medication treatment. She saw a massive improvement
          in Yoorellgoo when she returned on medication. Yarra encouraged the
          treatment plan and praised the medical staff especially Dr East. Yarra
          knew that Yoorellgoo was struggling with a series of mental illness
          relapses but thought this time the treatment was going to help. She
          always stayed optimistic. Yoorellgoo was lying to Dr East about her
          anxiety. When she tried to do her schoolwork, she couldn’t concentrate
          because she was so anxious. Dr East asked her, “Are you ready to speak
          about the information we discussed from your last hypnosis session?
          Yoorellgoo was reluctant to answer but nodded yes. “Okey, so
          Yoorellgoo when you were under you described that there was a loud
          bang in a living room. You said that you saw a figure in the lounge
          room as you peered out of a bedroom. You mentioned there was yelling.
          But then you stopped talking… did any other memories resurface since
          our last appointment?”. “No” she replied. Dr East noticed the
          shuffling of Yoorellgoo’s feet and the slight shake of her hands. “Are
          you prepared for another session? We can see whether you are able to
          remember your parents. We discussed that you would like to know who
          your biological parents are when you were admitted for your last
          mental health assessment”. Yoorellgoo started to think that she only
          said that because that’s what was expected. That was the normal
          response. She didn’t really care today and maybe she wouldn’t care
          tomorrow either. “I don’t think I’m up for a session today Dr East. I
          had a late night”. Dr East took notes. “So, your sleep hasn’t
          improved?”. “No, my sleep is fine. I just didn’t keep track of the
          time and stayed up scrolling Facebook” answered Yoorellgoo. “Okey, I
          must advise you that you do require eight hours of sleep each evening
          Yoorellgoo. Especially while you are recovering. I’m going to
          prescribe a low dose of Quetiapine to help you sleep”. As Dr East
          wrote out the prescription Yoorellgoo thought, “Another pill to throw
          in the bin”. Yarra arrived at the hospital as Hilary had called her to
          say that Yoorellgoo’s appointment was nearly over. Yarra then went
          into Clinic Room A to discuss the recommendations that Dr East wanted
          to discuss. Yoorellgoo stayed in the waiting room while watching the
          game show Deal or No Deal. Once they were in the car Yarra asked,
          “Weren’t up to it today bub? The hypnosis session? Hope you aren’t
          pushing yourself”. “I’m okay Mum” reassured Yoorellgoo.
